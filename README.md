# Project Title

## Getting Started

App allows to save location on the map (POI or any) and used Geofences to send notification once you are near saved location(s)

## Built With

This app uses Google maps, thus you need you own key. Check https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key. Note: there is much more better approach to save key in local.propeties. Unfortunately I haven't yet changed it in this project. Add you key in google_maps_api.xml
